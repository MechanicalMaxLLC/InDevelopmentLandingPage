# InDevelopmentLandingPage
A simple static landing page for our website while we work out our business plan and develop our site

## Goals
Hosting a site on a website-builder platform can get expensive, especially since I don't have time to run a consistent business during the school semester. So, I'm building and hosting this single static page to redirect people who find my site to my LinkedIn, YouTube, and Github accounts. That way, I can stay connected to my business's website while the business plan and full website are under development.

## Site Look
Use node.js, tailwindcss, and AWS as tech stack to build page

Include PDF document of future site plan, logo images, and subscribe button. Also include links to your other social media. Finally, include some text to address the audience.
